The first part of multi-part assignment of this course, the notebook. In this notebook the user is able to add, read and delete notes from a separate note file "notebook.txt".


Create a program which allows the user to
(1) Read the contents of the notebook
(2) Add notes to the file or
(3) Delete all of the notes.
If the user selects 1, the entire notebook file is printed to the screen, if 2 then the program prompts "Write a new note: ", and adds the written note as the last line into the file with a trailing line break "\n". If the player selects 3, the file is emptied and the message "Notes deleted" will be shown. Also add the option (4) Quit, which ends the program, printing "Notebook shutting down, thank you.". With other selections the program prompts "Incorrect selection".

When working, the program prints following:

(1) Read the notebook
(2) Add note
(3) Empty the notebook
(4) Quit

Please select one: 2
Write a new note: Buy new tires
(1) Read the notebook

The last exercise in this chapter adds a small feature to the other continuous exercise project, the notebook. In this exercise, add a feature which includes the date and time of the written note to the program. The program works as earlier, but saves data in the form "[note]:::[date and time]" meaning that there is a three-colon separator between the note and timestamp. The timestamp can be generated as follows:
	
>>> import time		

>>> time.strftime("%X %x")
'19:01:34 01/03/09'
>>>
