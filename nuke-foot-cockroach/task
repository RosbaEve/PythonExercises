In this exercise the objective is to develop a game called nuke-foot-cockroach, which is pretty similar to the more popular variant, paper-rock-scissors. The rules are simple: both players select either nuke, foot or cockroach, and the winner is determined in the following way: Foot beats cockroach, nuke beats foot and cockroach beats nuke. If both the player and the AI select the same, it's a tie, except if both choose nuke, then both lose.


Implement the game so that the other player is computer controlled, and chooses randomly either foot(number 1), cockroach(number 3) or nuke(number 2). Also implement a feature which keeps the score, calculating both rounds the player won, and ties. If the player wins, print "You WIN!", if they loose "You LOSE!". If the round was a tie, either "It is a tie!" or "Both LOSE!", depending on if the tie was caused by a nuke or not. If the player selects "quit", the game ends and the final score is given. When the game works correctly, it prints the following:
